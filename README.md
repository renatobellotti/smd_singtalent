# Voting Tool for the yearly concert of the Stadtmusik Dietikon in 2019
This repo contains a small voting tool. The code is based on the [landing page Bootstrap theme](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/landing-page/).

The actual code can be found in the files ```vote.php```, ```admin.php``` and ```helpers.php```.

Everything that needs to be modified for a production environment can be found in ```helpers.php```: The database configuration, and the URL of the landing page for the voting tool.
